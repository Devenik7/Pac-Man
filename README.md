# Pac Man

Made this ages ago during my learning days of Javascript and patterns. 

Use the link above and Use W S A D for movement.

It's still pretty basic but the <i>AI does feel like it's onto us but at the same time unpredicatble giving it a future-thinking feel</i>.

The controls are bit jaggy since the last but one input is also remembered thus most time resulting in auto-movement. 
<i>Tread Carefully</i>
